## Content

	### Innovation

	It is possible to choose between different vehicles, which behave differently. With some of the vehicles you can get off course, but the fun part is to try to stay inside (also, it is fun that way!); however, the timer will still be on, so don't take a lot of time going back to your last checkpoint.

		You have a turbo as well with [SPACE].

	The track has different zones, which have an element base to have different obstacles.

	Each trait that makes the course interesting:

	**Water course:** it has a lake.
	**Earth course:** it has a mountain.
	**Forest course:** it has bushes.
	**Fire course:** it has fire archs.

	The Window will show you all the comands to select the car, if you've won/lost, etc.

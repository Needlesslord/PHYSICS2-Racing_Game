	### Innovation

	It is possible to choose between different vehicles, which behave differently.

	The track has different zones, which have an element base to have different obstacles.

	Each course has a trait that makes it interesting:

		**Water course:** it has waterfalls, sea breeze and part of the course is under water.
		**Earth course:** it has bumps and potholes, obstacles and landslides.
		**Air course:** it has wind randomized and jumps where wind is applied upwards.
		**Fire course:** it will have fire coming from the walls, fire-jumps and fire archs.
